Characteristics Linear Data Structure : Sequential Organization : linear data structures , data elements arranged sequentially , . element unique predecessor ( element ) unique successor ( element ) Order Preservation : order elements added data structure preserved . means element added accessed removed , element added accessed removed . Fixed Dynamic Size : Linear data structures fixed dynamic sizes . Arrays typically fixed size created , structures like linked lists , stacks , queues dynamically grow shrink elements added removed . Efficient Access : Accessing elements linear data structure typically efficient . example , arrays offer constant - time access elements index . Linear data structures commonly organising manipulating data sequential fashion . common linear data structures include : Arrays : collection elements stored contiguous memory locations . Linked Lists : collection nodes , containing element reference node . Stacks : collection elements - - - ( LIFO ) order . Queues : collection elements - - - ( FIFO ) order . 1 . Array array collection items data type stored contiguous memory locations . Array Characteristics Array Data Structure : Homogeneous Elements : elements array data type . Contiguous Memory Allocation : programming languages , elements array stored contiguous ( adjacent ) memory locations . Zero - Based Indexing : programming languages , arrays use zero - based indexing , means element accessed index 0 , second index 1 , . Random Access : Arrays provide constant - time ( O(1 ) ) access elements . means regardless size array , takes time access element based index . Types arrays : - Dimensional Array : simplest form array , consists single row elements , data type . Elements 1D array accessed single index . - Dimensional Array - Dimensional Array : - dimensional array , referred matrix 2D array , array arrays . consists rows columns , forming grid - like structure . Elements 2D array accessed indices , row column . - Dimensional Array : Multi - Dimensional Array : Arrays dimensions , leading multi - dimensional arrays . data needs organized multi - dimensional grid . Multi - Dimensional Array Types Array operations : Accessing Elements : Accessing specific element array index constant - time operation . time complexity O(1 ) . Insertion : Appending element end array usually constant - time operation , O(1 ) insertion beginning specific index takes O(n ) time requires shifting elements . Deletion : insertion , deleting element constant - time operation , O(1 ) deletion element beginning specific index takes O(n ) time requires shifting elements . Searching : Linear Search takes O(n ) time useful unsorted data   Binary Search takes O(logn ) time useful sorted data . 2 . Linked List L inked List linear data structure looks like chain nodes , node contains data field reference(link ) node list . Unlike Arrays , Linked List elements stored contiguous location . Common Features Linked List : Node : element linked list represented node , contains components : Data : actual data value associated element . Pointer(or Link ): reference pointer node linked list . Head : node linked list called “ head . ” serves starting point traversing list . Tail : node linked list called “ tail . ” Types Linked Lists : Singly Linked List : type linked list , node stores address reference node list node address reference NULL . example : 1->2->3->4->NULL Singly Linked List Doubly Linked Lists : doubly linked list , node pointers : pointing node pointing previous node . bidirectional structure allows efficient traversal directions . Doubly Linked Lists Circular Linked Lists : circular linked list type linked list nodes connected form circle , NULL end . Circular Linked Lists Types Linked List operations : Accessing Elements : Accessing specific element linked list takes O(n ) time nodes stored non conitgous locations random access possible . Searching : Searching node linked list takes O(n ) time list needs travesed worst case . Insertion : Insertion takes O(1 ) time position insert element . Deletion : Deletion takes O(1 ) time know position element deleted . 3 . Stack Data Structure stack linear data structure follows - - - ( LIFO ) principle , meaning element added stack removed . Stack Data structure Types Stacks : Fixed Size Stack : suggests , fixed size stack fixed size grow shrink dynamically . stack attempt add element , overflow error occurs . stack attempt remove element , underflow error occurs . Dynamic Size Stack : dynamic size stack grow shrink dynamically . stack , automatically increases size accommodate new element , stack , decreases size . type stack implemented linked list , allows easy resizing stack . Stack Operations : push ( ): operation performed , element inserted stack . pop ( ): operation performed , element removed stack returned . ( ): operation return inserted element removing . size ( ): operation return size stack i.e. total number elements present stack . isEmpty ( ): operation indicates stack . 4 . Queue Data Structure queue linear data structure follows - - - ( FIFO ) principle . queue , element added removed . Queue Data Structure Types Queue : Input Restricted Queue : simple queue . type queue , input taken end deletion ends . Output Restricted Queue : simple queue . type queue , input taken ends deletion end . Circular Queue : special type queue position connected position . operations performed FIFO order . know refer . Double - Ended Queue ( Dequeue ): double - ended queue insertion deletion operations , performed ends . know refer . Priority Queue : priority queue special queue elements accessed based priority assigned . know refer . Queue Operations : Enqueue ( ): Adds ( stores ) element end queue .. Dequeue ( ): Removal elements queue . Peek ( ) ( ): Acquires data element available node queue deleting . rear ( ): operation returns element rear end removing . isFull ( ): Validates queue . isNull ( ): Checks queue . Advantages Linear Data Structures Efficient data access : Elements easily accessed position sequence . Dynamic sizing : Linear data structures dynamically adjust size elements added removed . Ease implementation : Linear data structures easily implemented arrays linked lists . Versatility : Linear data structures applications , searching , sorting , manipulation data . Simple algorithms : algorithms linear data structures simple straightforward . Disadvantages Linear Data Structures Limited data access : Accessing elements stored end beginning sequence time - consuming . Memory overhead : Maintaining links elements linked lists pointers stacks queues consume additional memory . Complex algorithms : algorithms linear data structures , searching sorting , complex time - consuming . Inefficient use memory : Linear data structures result inefficient use memory gaps memory allocation . Unsuitable certain operations : Linear data structures suitable operations require constant random access elements , searching element large dataset .
