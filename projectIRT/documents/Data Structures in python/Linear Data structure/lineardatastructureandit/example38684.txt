Types Linear Data Structures ? Linear data structures vary store elements , handle insertion deletion , manage memory . type addresses different scenarios priorities , need random access , dynamic growth , strict ordering . Understanding distinct patterns subtype makes easier choose best meets project requirements . 1 . Arrays Data Structures array fundamental linear data structure arranges elements contiguous memory locations . element array shares data type , position accessed index . positions lie , certain tasks — like iterating elements — straightforward . , arrays usually require knowing size start , expand easily created . handled correctly , known providing fast lookup times elements index supporting clear , orderly data storage . Characteristics Arrays Data Structures Homogeneous Elements : item array data type . Contiguous Memory Allocation : elements sit memory , helps access index . Zero - Based Indexing : programming languages , element index 0 , second index 1 , . Fixed Size : array size set , generally changed runtime . Operations Arrays Access : Elements retrieved index ( e.g. , array[3 ] access fourth element ) . Insertion : Adding new value end typically fast , inserting middle involves shifting elements , extra time . Deletion : Removing element quick removing element middle demands shifting . Searching : Linear search scans element match found , binary search sorted arrays faster lookups . Types Arrays main types Arrays examples listed . 1 . - Dimensional Array - dimensional array arranges elements single row , accessed single index . layout straightforward nature suits tasks data handled direct , linear format . initialized , keeps defined size use dynamic variant provided certain programming languages . example - dimensional Arrays . Consider storing marks students class . position array represents different student : Indexes : [ 0 ] [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Elements : [ 85 ] [ 90 ] [ 78 ] [ 92 ] [ 88 ] marks[0 ] = 85 indicates mark student . marks[3 ] = 92 reflects fourth student mark . referencing marks[i ] , directly read modify student data scanning entire structure . Read : Dimensional Arrays C : Definition , Types Example 2 . - Dimensional Array - dimensional array stacks data rows columns , essentially forming matrix . element addressed indices — row column . pattern tabular data storage , image matrices , setup benefits row - column classification . Consider table student marks multiple subjects : Index [ 0][0 ] [ 0][1 ] [ 1][0 ] [ 1][1 ] Subjects 85 90 78 82 marks[0][1 ] mean mark student second subject . row column indices help isolate exact location mark . Read : - Dimensional Array C Programming Example 3 . Multi - Dimensional Array Multi - dimensional arrays extend dimensions , allowing map data multiple layers , like - dimensional ( 3D ) higher . approach practical advanced data visualization modeling tasks involving rows columns . Envision 3D array storing color channels ( Red , Green , Blue ) small images : Dimension 0 1 2 Pixel ( x , y ) ( R , G , B ) ( R , G , B ) ( R , G , B ) coordinate point 3 - value set , reflecting intensities red , green , blue position . Accessing imageData[x][y][z ] fetches intensity z th color channel ( x , y ) . configurations provide structured way represent complex data , code grow intricate dimensions increase . Read : Multidimensional Array Java 2 . Linked List Data Structure linked list data structure arranges items nodes , node contains data reference ( pointer ) node . design spares allocating fixed block memory advance new nodes created needed . node placed memory , making inserting removing elements easier shifting item list . retrieval tends slower arrays — follow pointers — linked lists excel situations frequent changes sequence expected . Characteristics Linked Lists Data Structures Node - Based Structure : element resides node , holds data pointer ( multiple pointers ) . layout allows flexible distribution nodes memory . Non - Contiguous Storage : Unlike arrays , linked list nodes necessarily stored ; pointers link correct sequence . Dynamic Growth : Nodes added removed fly , list length fixed upfront . Traversal Dependency : Reaching specific element typically involves traversing head node element found . Operations Linked Lists Insertion : Add new node adjusting pointers near insertion spot . head , middle , tail , large block data needs shifting . Deletion : Remove node link predecessor directly successor . node delete located , usually takes constant time , searching O(n ) . Traversal : head node link end list reached . step - - step approach linear complexity ( O(n ) ) . Searching : Examine node target data found . list long , process time - consuming . Types Linked Lists main types examples discussed . 1 . Singly Linked List singly linked list – known linear list data structure – connects node exactly node , called node . final node indicates end sequence pointing . style streamlines storage needs pointer maintained , add remove nodes head tail shuffling data . Let understand linear list data structure example : Managing Media Playlist node contains song title pointer track . Diagram Representation : HEAD - > [ Song ] - > [ Song B ] - > [ Song C ] - > NULL Song links Song B , Song B links Song C , Song C shows null pointer . adding new tune middle , pointer Song rerouted new node , links Song B. Deleting track requires redirecting pointer predecessor successor relocating files . 2 . Doubly Linked List doubly linked list enhances concept giving node pointers : pointing node previous node . - way structure supports direct movement forward backward , allowing certain operations — like reverse traversal immediate node removal — direct . example better understanding : Browsing Photos Gallery node represents image forward pointer ( ) backward pointer ( prev ) . Diagram Representation : NULL < - [ Photo 1 ] < - > [ Photo 2 ] < - > [ Photo 3 ]   - >   NULL Photo 1 predecessor , Photo 3 successor . backward Photo 3 Photo 2 , Photo 1 , forward Photo 1 onward . Removing Photo 2 involves making Photo 1 Photo 3 point , keeping rest unchanged . 3 . Circular Linked List circular linked list forms loop connecting final node . null pointer ; instead , chain continues . setup helpful want cycle elements repeatedly resetting start . Let understand example : Rotating Players Board Game Nodes represent participant , looping player . Diagram Representation : ┌ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┐ 
 HEAD - > [ Player ] - > [ Player B ] - > [ Player C ]  
         └ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┘ 
             ( loops ) Player C finishes turn , pointer leads Player , maintaining continuous round - robin . Adding new player means linking existing node pointer newcomer , points line . Removing requires - linking neighbors , keeps cycle intact . 3 . Stack Data Structures stack follows - , - ( LIFO ) order , recent item added removed . Elements join leave stack , means rearrange shift stored items . design works particularly order removal mirror order insertion , undo operations nested function calls . Stacks appear need track reversing sequence actions manage nested processes . Characteristics Stack Data Structures LIFO Principle : element placed stack removed , preserving exact reversed order insertion . Single Access Point : insertions ( push ) deletions ( pop ) happen , know operation occurs . Finite Capacity : stack implementations come predefined limit , expand dynamically accommodate entries . Temporary Holding : Stacks frequently serve short - term storage items need quick reversal step - - step rollback . Operations Stack Data Structures Push : Place new element . stack space , process takes constant time . Pop : Remove element return . directly remove items lower stack popping . Peek ( ): View item currently modifying stack . isEmpty : Check elements left stack . size : Determine elements stack given moment . Types Stacks main types stacks handle size memory differently 1 . Fixed Size Stack fixed - size stack predefined capacity . holds maximum number elements , attempting push cause overflow error . Example : Limited Undo History Simple Drawing Application Suppose small program stores 5 user actions ( like strokes shape insertions ) stack . 5 actions , pushing sixth action triggers overflow , discarding oldest record . Users latest steps undo , reflecting fixed size limit . Diagram Representation ( Capacity = 5 ):   - > [ Action 5 ] 
       [ Action 4 ] 
       [ Action 3 ] 
       [ Action 2 ] 
       [ Action 1 ]    < --   Oldest   remains     Push : Inserting action fails stack . Pop : Taking action reverts recent change , reducing total actions 4 . 2 . Dynamic Size Stack dynamic size stack expands ( shrink ) according number items hold . allows flexibility storing data sequences restricted initial limit . Example : Extensive Command Records Advanced Code Editor coding action — typing line , deleting function , reformatting code — pushes stack . strict cap , users adding new commands long memory permits . Undo operations pop items LIFO pattern , recent command removed . Diagram Representation ( Size Grows Actions Increase ):   - > [ Action 7 ] 
       [ Action 6 ] 
       [ Action 5 ] 
       ... 
       [ Action 1 ]    < --     earliest   action Push : new command placed , memory needed , stack reallocates links new node . Pop : action discarded , returning editor earlier state . continues actions undone user stops . Read : Implement Stacks Data Structure ? Stack Operations Explained 4 . Queues Data Structures queue linear data structure follows - , - ( FIFO ) principle . place new elements ( known rear ) , items leave . earliest added item exit , queues - suited scenarios order matters , managing tasks , requests , resources . structure ensures element served sequence enqueued , supporting fair distribution systematic processing . Characteristics Queues Data Structures FIFO Principle : element enter leave , retaining strict order . Distinct Ends : queue removal rear insertion . Fair Ordering : elements depart order arrive , queue promotes equitable approach handling tasks data . Fixed Dynamic : queue implementations set capacity , grow handle entries memory allows . Operations Queues Data Structures Enqueue : Add new element rear O(1 ) time space available . Dequeue : Remove element O(1 ) time , returning caller . ( peek ): View element removing . Rear : Identify element queue dequeue operation . isEmpty / isFull : Check queue elements filled capacity . Types Queues main types queues data structures . 1 . Input Restricted Queue type queue accepts new entries end , removal occur rear . grants flexibility elements exit , insertion remains controlled single point . Restaurant Orders Example Imagine restaurant accepts new orders counter ( rear ) , completed orders picked kitchen ( ) canceled end : Rear - > [ New Order # 101 ] - > [ Order # 99 ] - > [ Order # 100 ] < - Enqueue : accepted left ( rear ) . Dequeue : Typically right ( ) order ready , cancellation remove item rear needed . Indexes look like : Index [ 0 ] [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Data # 101 # 99 # 100 Ends Rear ( middle ) [ 0 ] : New order arrives . [ 1 ] : older order ( # 99 ) sits queue . [ 2 ] : Standard serving exit . [ 0 ] : handle removal quick cancellation processed right adding . upGrad Exclusive Data Science Webinar – Build Digital & Data Mindset https://cdn.upgrad.com/blog/webinar-on-building-digital-and-data-mindset.mp4 2 . Output Restricted Queue nearly opposite input restricted queue . allows inserting items rear , removal happen end ( usually ) . fits scenarios rapid insertion multiple directions needed keeps single exit path . Shared Printer Example users enqueue print jobs different points , jobs dequeued fixed printer ready : - > [ Job # 12 ] - > [ Job # 13 ] - > [ Job # 14 ] < - Rear 
             ↑                    ↑ 
     Insertions happen ends indexes look like : Index [ 0 ] [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Data Job # 12 Job # 13 Job # 14 Ends ( middle ) Rear Enqueue : Special admin job priority joining . Enqueue Rear : Normal jobs join . Dequeue : , following standard queue pattern . 3 . Circular Queue circular queue links position , stopping issue “ unused slots ” simple array - based queue rear index hits end . space free , rear loop . Printer Task Buffer Example Consider printer queue tracked array size 4 : Index [ 0 ] [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Data Task # Task # B ( ) Task # C 0 Rear 2 Enqueue index 2 , despite rear previously 3 . Dequeue removes item index 0 , 1 . task removed , slot effectively frees , incoming task occupy [ 2 ] wasting space . 4 . Double - Ended Queue ( Deque ) double - ended queue ( deque ) allows enqueuing dequeuing rear . flexibility beneficial need quickly push pop items restrictions imposed typical queues . Web Browser History Navigation Example user browsing history treated like deque : < - > [ Page   1 ] < - > [ Page   2 ] < - > [ Page   3 ] < - > [ Page   4 ] < - > Rear Add Rear : New pages inserted right end . Remove : Possibly clearing oldest pages history large . Insert : allow special features , reloading bookmarking certain pages priority slots . Indexes reflect quick additions ends : Index [ 0 ] [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Data Page 1 Page 2 Page 3 Page 4 Ends Rear 5 . Priority Queue priority queue reorders elements based priority strictly following FIFO . Higher - priority items removed , regardless arrived . System Tasks Scheduling Example Processes arrive different times , priority value : Priorities : High    | Low    | High    | Medium 
 Data :        Task#8 |   Task#9|   Task#10|   Task#11 High - priority tasks ( Task#8 , Task#10 ) jump ahead immediate processing . Medium Low tasks ( Task#9 , Task#11 ) wait higher - priority tasks remain . ensures critical processes handled important ones . Want understand difference stacks queues data structures ?
