Python Data Structures : 4 Main Types ? Lists Tuples Sets Dictionaries Python Data Structures — Lists , Tuples , Sets & Dictionaries Tutorial . | Video : Joe James Data Structure ? data structure way organize data computer memory easily accessed computer programs . data structure specific format organizing , processing , retrieving storing data , allowing data manipulated ways users computer systems . Data structures fundamental modern software programming languages . built - user - defined , range basic advanced types . Built - vs. User - Defined Data Structures Python Built - data structures data structures supported default programming language . come pre - defined syntax behavior , having import additional libraries modules . Python , includes data structures like lists , tuples , sets dictionaries . User - defined data structures data structures created users supported natively programming language , work achieve similar functionality existing programming concepts . user - defined data structure users control data manipulate program , implemented importing additional libraries modules . Python , user - defined data structures include arrays , stacks , queues , trees , linked lists , graphs hash maps . 4 Built - Python Data Structures ? primary built - data structures Python lists , sets , tuples dictionaries . 1 . Lists Lists type data structure containing ordered collection items . crucial executing projects Python . item contained list inherent order identify , remains consistent life list . Lists mutable , allowing elements searched , added , moved deleted creation . Lists nested , allowing contain object , including lists sublists . Creating List Python # creating list 
 my_list = [ ] 

 # filling printing list 
 my_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , “ abc ” , 1.5 ] 
 print(my_list ) 

 # Output : [ 1 , 2 , 3 , ‘ abc ’ , 1.5 ] 2 . Tuples tuple contains functionality list , albeit limited functionality . primary difference tuple immutable , meaning modified deleted defined . Tuples best user intends object intact lifetime prevent modification addition data . Creating Tuple Python # creating tuple 
 my_tuple = ( ) 

 # filling printing tuple 
 my_tuple = ( 1 , 2 , 3 , “ abc ” , 1.5 ) 
 print(my_tuple ) 

 # Output : ( 1 , 2 , 3 , ‘ abc ’ , 1.5 ) 3 . Sets set collection unique elements defined order , utilized object needs exist collection objects order number appearances important . Creating Set Python # creating printing set 
 my_set = { 1 , 2 , 3 , “ abc ” , 1.5 } 
 print(my_set ) 

 # output elements tuple randomized , vary time program run 4 . Dictionaries Dictionaries unique immutable objects consist key - value pairs accessible unique keys dictionary . Creating Dictionary Python # creating dictionary 
 my_dict = { } 

 # filling printing dictionary 
 my_dict = 	 { 
     " " : " Bob " , 
     " occupation " : " Programmer " , 
     " start date " : 1984 
 } 

 print(my_dict ) 

 # keys access certain values 
 = my_dict["name " ] 
 occupation = my_dict["occupation " ] 

 # printing key values 
 print(name , " , " , occupation ) User - Defined Data Structures Python ? User - defined data structures add additional functionality Python , allowing users access , modify preserve data specific ways . addition Python built - data structures , number user - defined data structures use , arrays , stacks , queues , trees . user - defined data structures considered advanced Python data structures , functionality extends basic data structures included Python . Arrays : Arrays function similarly lists , allow homogeneous elements stored , lists contain heterogeneous elements . Stacks : Stacks linear data structures data published accessed . Stacks commonly utilized recursive programming undo functions word processors . Queues : queue works opposite stack based - - - ( FIFO ) principle , data entered accessed . Trees : Trees non - linear data structures incorporate roots nodes create hierarchy data . structures heavily HTML pages . Linked lists : Linked lists abstract data structures data organized nodes link list - like format . efficient needing insert , find remove items , comparison regular arrays lists . Related 3 Ways Write Pythonic Conditional Statements Python Data Structures : Advantages Disadvantages data structure offers different way completing tasks sorting , inserting finding , efficiency depends situation . data structure ultimately better , task designed support lead longer workflows , worse , skewed data . Linked lists purpose - built inserting deleting data offer sequential access data , means searching sorting problematic . Similar list , tuples outputting entire tuple individual elements , use memory space allow sorting , adding , replacing deleting elements defined . Sets intentionally designed limited excel checking value existence avoiding duplicates set . Dictionaries allow data collected key - value pairs , making excellent quick retrievals unstructured documents , limited work large amounts tabular data . Arrays easy create excellent completing tasks involve working sequential data , sorting , inserting deleting items shift positions item array . Stacks excellent adding removing data entered database , queues meant add remove data entered data set , want pull item middle set , benefit different data structure . Binary search trees allow access , sort delete data quickly maintaining sorted order element   s retrieved . Despite advantages , binary search trees require tedious work create manage . Frequently Asked Questions 4 data structures Python ? 4 main built - data structures Python : Lists Tuples Sets Dictionaries Python good data structures ? Yes , Python considered good choice learning data structures algorithms programming . Python simple syntax wide range standard libraries available working data structures data manipulation . difference tuple list Python ? Python , tuples immutable objects fixed length defined , lists mutable objects dynamic length defined . Tuples use memory lists , making faster generate access .
