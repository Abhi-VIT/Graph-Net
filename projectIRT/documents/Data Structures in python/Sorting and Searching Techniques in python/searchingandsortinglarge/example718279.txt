Learn Teams Searching sorting large data set Ask Question Asked 10 years , 2 months ago Modified 10 years , 2 months ago Viewed 4k times 1 practicing algorithm questions interviews stumbled questions relate sorting data comes infinite stream designing data structure search billions records Describe sort integers read time infinite stream Search tremendous number elements search space . I.E. asked design storage structure search algorithm 
   search 100 billion data records . multiple 
   servers multiple threads . think , correct wrong better solution sorting integers read time infinite stream , use insertion sort ? Worst case insertion sort O(n2 ) sort unsorted list case run time lowered O(logn ) . new element inserted sorted stream , perform binary search new element insert logn time . need shift items right 1 result O(N ) . 
 sure right use Balanced BST worst case insertion searching logN use HashMap ideally perform lookup O(1 ) insertion O(1 ) . dealing 100 billion records , worst case lookup HashMap O(N ) linked list implementation . clear answer questions . provide insight , great ! thanks ! algorithm sorting data - structures Share Improve question Follow asked Feb 23 , 2015 3:02 Htlcs Htlcs 565 4 4 gold badges 13 13 silver badges 26 26 bronze badges 1 1 evenly distribute search space m , store m subsets m servers respectively . n / m data server , use hash table . sure load factor constant , i.e. , table grow size input , O(1 ) average search time . worse case , yes , try find good hash function . – Eric Z Commented Feb 23 , 2015 3:22 Add comment | 1 Answer 1 Sorted : Reset default Highest score ( default ) Trending ( recent votes count ) Date modified ( newest ) Date created ( oldest ) 5 sorting large data , typically steps : Buffer data comes received ( typically large ) number data items . sort write sorted block disk . continue received sorted data . sorted blocks , k - way merge sorted blocks create single sorted file . buffering sorting parallel horsepower . block received , spin thread sort main thread continues receive data new block . infinitely scalable , course , going longer sort large buffer receive . write block disk received , fixed number background threads sort blocks . basic algorithm , ... little time delayed . use multiple machines searching , typically spread data machines . 4 machines , machine gets 1/4 data . want search , machine search data set matching records , communicate results central place , sorts removes duplicates . , want maintain sorted data structure potentially infinite stream ( i.e. able search time data received ) , need dynamic . simple way main sorted structure , " sorted " buffer . , example , received billion items sorted stored , buffer size 1 million items . data received , store million items memory merge primary data structure . receive search query , search main structure , O(log N ) binary search , search receive buffer sequentially . Granted sequential search little slow sequential , data memory pay cost / O. buffer fills , use efficient algorithm merge stored structure . basic idea . ways improve efficiency multiple levels merging , better data structure binary tree similar .
