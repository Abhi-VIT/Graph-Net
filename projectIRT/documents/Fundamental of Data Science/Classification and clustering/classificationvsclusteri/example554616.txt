Poisson distributions , mixture exponential distributions , t - distributions , form clusters model - based setting . , depends type data picture . common applications model - based clustering include image segmentation , gene expression analysis , customer segmentation . Springer Link Density - based Clustering Imagine crowded city people gathering specific areas ( like parks , theatres , restaurants , etc . ) based interests . example , foodies gather neighborhood known restaurants . Density - based clustering method data analysis groups data points closely packed high - density regions . data points belong cluster , similar people area . Data points isolated areas low density considered noise assigned cluster , similar people particular group . Springer Link Hierarchical Clustering clustering technique results tree - like structures nested clusters having similar / merging data points based similarity . agglomerative ( starting individual data points merging larger clusters ) divisive ( starting data points large cluster recursively splitting smaller clusters ) . Examples Hierarchical clustering include CURE ( clustering representative ) , BIRCH ( balanced iterative reducing clustering hierarchies ) , etc . Hierarchical clustering widely biological classification , social network analysis , natural language processing , time series analysis , . eduCBA Applications Clustering hope , ahead classification vs clustering data mining debate .

Social Network Analysis Clustering group individuals social network based patterns interaction . , social networks mapped arranged nodes ( nodes people , personalities , entities ) . edges interlinks connect nodes represent relationships interactions . information identify key influencers communities network . Document Clustering Clustering algorithms widely group documents classes / clusters based similarity certain words , topics , features . , group documents similar sentiments , useful identify trends predict consumer behaviour . Additionally , use clustering technique topic modeling content analysis . Difference Classification Clustering ? Classification Clustering Objective assign pre - defined classes labels instances group similar instances based similarities Purpose Predicting class label unseen instances Discovering inherent patterns structures Supervision Supervised learning Unsupervised learning Training Requires labeled data training require labeled data Output Class label assignments Cluster assignments Example Predicting email spam Grouping customers based purchasing behavior classification , goal assign predefined classes labels instances based features . involves supervised learning requires labeled data training . output classification class label assignment . clustering , objective group instances share similarities predefined classes labels . unsupervised learning task require labeled data . clustering output cluster assignments , help identify patterns structures data . differences objectives , purposes , supervision , training , output , examples distinguish classification clustering distinct approaches data analysis . Similarities Classification Clustering difference classification clustering machine learning , similarities . starters , techniques data analysis machine learning . similar points mentioned . look primary structure processes , identical — group data classes / clusters . classification clustering gain insights predictions new data . classification clustering require careful selection features analyzed . Choosing Classification Clustering Making conscious decision machine learning clustering vs. classification depends factors . Read learn . labeled data , opt supervised classification algorithm , works best know input data potential outcomes process . example , choose classification know kind customer data wish segregate decide services products prefer . hand , common input dataset ( i.e. , unlabeled data ) , prefer clustering involves obtaining information input data assumptions outcome . example , social service company wishing develop policies . situation , standard dataset ( population ) wish identify cluster groups common characteristics . Medium Conclusion going blog , realize classification vs. clustering debate valid different types data ( labeled unlabeled ) approaches machine learning . powerful techniques data analysis group data points based similarities .
