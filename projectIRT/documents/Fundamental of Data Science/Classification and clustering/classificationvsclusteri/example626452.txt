Clustering - Practical Explanation Classification Vs . Clustering - Practical Explanation Tags : Big Data - clustering - classification - Machine Learning Classification clustering pattern identifying methods machine learning . post explain differences . Classification clustering methods pattern identification machine learning . techniques certain similarities , difference lies fact classification uses predefined classes objects assigned , clustering identifies similarities objects , groups according characteristics common differentiate groups objects . groups known " clusters " . field machine learning ( form artificial intelligence ) , clustering framed unsupervised learning ; , type algorithm set input data ( labelled ) , obtain information , previously knowing output . differences supervised unsupervised Machine Learning clustering ? Clustering projects companies want find common aspects customers apply customer segmentation , create customer journey maps find groups focus products services . , significant percentage customers certain aspects common ( age , type family , etc . ) company justify particular campaign , service product . Clustering useful obtain general insights information . classification ? hand , classification belongs supervised learning , means know input data ( labeled case ) know possible output algorithm . binary classification responds problems categorical answers ( " yes " " " , example ) , multiclassification , problems find classes , responding open answers " great " , " regular " " insufficient " . Classification fields , biology Dewey decimal classification books , detection spam e - mails ... Bismart , Microsoft Power BI partners , use classification clustering projects , framed different sectors . example , social services industry , clustering identify population groups use specific social services . social services data , able identify cluster groups people use similar services according attributes ( number people charge , degree dependency , marital status ... ) . , able detect type service new user social services need comparing attributes clusters . Classification need know users customers decide products campaigns launched future . example , Bismart developed project insurance industry client needed classify customers according accident claims , policy classified according number claims predicted . , company choose costumers lowest number claims . Classification vs. Clustering difference classification clustering algorithms ? classification clustering techniques machine learning pattern identification . involve grouping objects based similarities , key difference . Classification involves assigning objects predefined classes based characteristics . example , insurance industry , customers classified based accident claims determine appropriate policy . hand , clustering focuses identifying similarities objects grouping accordingly . useful scenarios customer segmentation , businesses tailor marketing campaigns services specific customer groups based common characteristics . Additionally , clustering algorithms fraud detection , recommendation systems , creation original series platforms like Netflix . conclusion , classification clustering offer valuable insights powerful tools businesses looking improve operations customer relations .
