Depending type clustering algorithm utilized , techniques employed group data datasets . , clustering techniques described . types clustering algorithms : Centroid - based Clustering ( Partitioning methods ) Density - based Clustering ( Model - based methods ) Connectivity - based Clustering ( Hierarchical clustering ) going types brief . 1 . Centroid - based Clustering ( Partitioning methods ) Centroid - based clustering organizes data points central vectors ( centroids ) represent clusters . data point belongs cluster nearest centroid . Generally , similarity measure chosen algorithms Euclidian distance , Manhattan Distance Minkowski Distance . datasets separated predetermined number clusters , cluster referenced vector values . compared vector value , input data variable shows difference joins cluster . major drawback centroid - based algorithms requirement establish number clusters , “ k , ” intuitively scientifically ( Elbow Method ) clustering machine learning system starts allocating data points . Despite limitation , remains popular type clustering simplicity efficiency . Popular algorithms Centroid - based clustering : K - means K - medoids clustering examples type clustering . 2 . Density - based Clustering ( Model - based methods ) Density - based clustering identifies clusters areas high density separated regions low density data space . Unlike centroid - based methods , density - based clustering automatically determines number clusters susceptible initialization positions . Key Characteristics : find arbitrarily shaped clusters Handles noise outliers Excels clusters different sizes shapes Ideal datasets irregularly shaped overlapping clusters Effectively manages dense sparse data regions Focus local density allows detection cluster morphologies popular density - based clustering algorithm DBSCAN OPTICS ( Ordering Points Identify Clustering Structure ) . 3 . Connectivity - based Clustering ( Hierarchical clustering ) Connectivity - based clustering builds hierarchy clusters measure connectivity based distance organizing collection items based similarities .   method builds dendrogram , tree - like structure visually represents relationships objects . base tree , object starts individual cluster . algorithm evaluates similar objects begins merging closest pairs clusters larger groups . process continues iteratively , clusters combined step step , objects united single cluster tree . 2 approaches Hierarchical clustering : Divisive Clustering : follows - approach , consider data points big cluster cluster divide smaller groups . Agglomerative Clustering : follows - approach , consider data points individual clusters clusters clubbed big cluster data points . implementing understand difference techniques , refer : Agglomerative clustering Divisive clustering Till , understood traditional “ hard ” clustering methods , data point assigned exactly cluster . methods , like K - Means hierarchical clustering , powerful widely , limitations dealing ambiguous overlapping data . learning hard clustering methods addresses limitations soft clustering allows data points belong multiple clusters simultaneously , varying degrees membership . approach particularly useful boundaries clusters clear - cut data points exhibit characteristics group . popular soft clustering techniques : 4 . Distribution - based Clustering Distribution - based clustering technique assumes data points generated mixture probability distributions ( e.g. , Gaussian , Poisson , etc . ) . goal identify clusters estimating parameters distributions .   distribution - based clustering : cluster represented probability distribution . Data points assigned clusters based likely belong distribution . Unlike distance - based methods ( e.g. , K - Means ) , approach capture clusters varying shapes , sizes , densities . real - world datasets , sensor data , financial data , biological measurements , naturally follow statistical distributions . popular distribution - based clustering algorithm Gaussian Mixture Model . 5 . Fuzzy Clustering Fuzzy clustering allows data points belong multiple clusters varying degrees membership . data point assigned membership value 0 1 cluster . membership values indicate degree data point belongs particular cluster . refer fuzzy clustering methods - depth understanding . method algorithms higher - level problem statements involving complex datasets Comment info Advertise Article K means Clustering - Introduction S Surya Priy Follow Improve Article Tags : AI - ML - DS Machine Learning ML - Clustering Practice Tags : Machine Learning Similar Reads Hierarchical Clustering Machine Learning real world data lacks target variable making supervised learning impractical . wondered social networks like Facebook recommend friends ... 15 + min read K means Clustering - Introduction K - Means Clustering Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm groups unlabeled dataset different clusters . article aims explore fundamentals ... 15 + min read Different Types Clustering Algorithm introduction clustering discussed article advised understood . clustering Algorithms types . following overview ... 15 + min read influence C SVMs linear kernel ?
