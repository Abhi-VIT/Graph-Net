Clustering algorithms segment customers , segment images , group text documents , group genes . Classification Clustering Classification ? Classification supervised learning technique , means requires labeled training dataset learn relationship features class labels . classifier trained , predict class label new , unseen data points . main types classification tasks : binary classification multiclass classification . Binary classification tasks involve classifying data exactly classes . classic example binary classification spam filtering , emails classified spam spam . examples binary classification tasks include fraud detection ( fraudulent fraudulent ) medical diagnosis ( cancerous cancerous ) . Multiclass classification tasks involve classifying data classes . example , image classification algorithm trained classify images different categories , cats , dogs , cars . examples multiclass classification tasks include text classification ( news article , blog post , social media post ) product recommendation ( clothing , electronics , home goods ) . Classification Works ? Classification algorithms work learning patterns data . patterns associated predefined class . algorithm learned patterns , predict class new , unseen data points . example , spam filter learn emails certain keywords phrases likely spam . spam filter learned patterns , predict new email likely spam . Real - World Examples Classification Spam filtering — Classifying emails spam spam Fraud detection — Classifying transactions fraudulent fraudulent Medical diagnosis — Classifying patient condition particular disease Product recommendation — Recommending products customers based past purchase history Customer segmentation — Classifying customers different segments based demographics purchase behavior common classification algorithms include : Logistic regression , Decision trees , Random forests , Support vector machines , Naive Bayes algorithms binary multiclass classification . example , logistic regression , decision trees , random forests binary multiclass classification . , algorithms specifically designed binary multiclass classification . example , SVMs typically binary classification , neural networks typically multiclass classification . Clustering ? Clustering unsupervised learning technique , means require labeled data . Clustering algorithms group data points based similarity , need predefined class labels . main types clustering algorithms : centroid - based clustering , density - based clustering , distribution - based clustering , hierarchical clustering . Centroid - based clustering algorithms partition data predefined number clusters . clusters defined centroids , average values data points cluster . K - means algorithm popular centroid - based clustering algorithm . Centroid - based Clustering K - means works randomly initializing set centroids . , data point assigned cluster closest centroid . centroids updated average values data points cluster . process repeated centroids longer change . Density - based clustering algorithms group data points based density . clusters defined regions high data point density . algorithms able handle noise outliers data effectively centroid - based clustering algorithms . Density - based Clustering DBSCAN algorithm popular density - based clustering algorithm . DBSCAN works identifying core points , data points certain number neighbors certain distance . cluster defined data points reachable core points . Distribution - based clustering : Distribution - based clustering algorithms group data points based underlying probability distributions data . algorithms assume data composed mixture probability distributions , attempt identify parameters distributions . parameters distributions identified , data point assigned distribution likely belong . Distribution - based clustering Gaussian Mixture Model ( GMM ) popular distribution - based clustering algorithm . GMMs assume data mixture Gaussian distributions . algorithm attempts identify parameters Gaussian distributions assign data point Gaussian distribution likely belong . Hierarchical clustering type connectivity - based clustering algorithm . means groups data points based close , similar . Hierarchical clustering Hierarchical clustering agglomerative divisive . Agglomerative algorithms start data point cluster iteratively merge similar clusters . Divisive algorithms start data points single cluster iteratively split cluster smaller smaller clusters . Hierarchical clustering algorithms produce dendrogram , tree - like diagram shows clusters related . Clustering Works ? Clustering algorithms work learning patterns data grouping similar data points . patterns associated predefined classes , similarity data points . algorithm learned patterns , group new , unseen data points clusters based similarity existing clusters . example , customer segmentation algorithm learn customers purchase similar products tend cluster . algorithm learn customers spend similar amounts money tend cluster . clustering algorithm learned patterns , group new customers clusters based purchase behavior . Real - World Examples Clustering Image segmentation — Grouping pixels image different segments , objects , background , foreground Text clustering — Grouping text documents different clusters based content Anomaly detection — Identifying data points anomalous unusual , fraudulent transactions network intrusions clustering technique use ? best clustering algorithm use depends specific application nature data . data - defined clear separation clusters , centroid - based clustering algorithm , K - means , good choice . data noisy outliers , density - based clustering algorithm , DBSCAN , better choice . data complex clear separation clusters , distribution - based clustering algorithm , GMM , better choice . Hierarchical clustering algorithms variety applications , including exploratory data analysis , feature engineering , anomaly detection . , hierarchical clustering algorithms computationally expensive , especially large datasets .
