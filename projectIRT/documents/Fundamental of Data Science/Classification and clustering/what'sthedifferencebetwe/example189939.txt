Written Karin Kelley | Updated July 29 , 2024 Data integral decision - making industries , driving surge demand skilled data analytics professionals . proficient data analyst , crucial understand extract value complex data . vital knowing difference classification clustering . article , explore concepts classification vs. clustering , differ , real - world applications . Enrolling data analytics bootcamp hands - experience techniques aspiring data professional . Classification : Types ? Classification machine learning sorts data categories based features . predicts category new data belongs binary classification ( sorting groups ) multi - class classification ( sorting groups ) . techniques use patterns past data correctly classify new data points based identified features . Read : Data Analytics ? Types , Roles , Techniques Types Classification Algorithms following types classification algorithms Logistic Regression Logistic Regression linear model classification tasks . applies sigmoid function estimate probability event occurring based input data . particularly effective categorical variables . K - Nearest Neighbors ( kNN ) kNN calculates distances data point points metrics like Euclidean Manhattan distance . classifies data point majority vote k nearest neighbors . Decision Trees Decision Trees nonlinear models classify data tree structure nodes leaves . break complex structures smaller ones - statements reach final decision , helpful regression classification problems . Random Forest Random Forest uses multiple decision trees predict outcomes . tree produces distinct result , combined predictions determine final classification regression result . Naïve Bayes Naïve Bayes method uses Bayes ’ theorem predictions based past data . assumes feature data unrelated , works straightforward data sets . , features data interconnected complex ways , Naïve Bayes struggle accurate predictions . Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) SVM maps data points higher - dimensional space uses flat boundaries called hyperplanes separate different categories . adjusts boundaries maximize space , helping classify data accurately multiple dimensions . Clustering ? Clustering unsupervised machine learning algorithm organizes data points clusters based shared properties . primary goal ensure data points cluster exhibit similar characteristics different clusters distinctly different . main types clustering methods : Soft clustering : Items belong group simultaneously . example , item “ red ” “ round ” groups . Hard clustering : item assigned group . , item “ red ” group “ round ” group , . main goal clustering create groups items group similar , items different groups different possible . helps find patterns similarities data effectively . Read : Beginner Guide Data Analytics Finance Types Clustering Algorithms following types clustering algorithms K - means Clustering K - means clustering starts defining fixed number k segments . uses distance metrics calculate distance data point cluster centers segments . data point assigned k groups based distance points . Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering method forms clusters merging data points according distance metrics criteria connecting clusters . Divisive Hierarchical Clustering Divisive Hierarchical Clustering starts grouping data cluster . divides groups measures proximity specific rules . types hierarchical clustering shown dendrogram , helps decide best number clusters . DBSCAN DBSCAN density - based clustering method . Unlike K - means , works best - separated round clusters , DBSCAN handle clusters shape easily affected outliers . groups data points close points specified distance . OPTICS OPTICS density - based clustering method like DBSCAN includes extra factors . requires computation DBSCAN . OPTICS creates reachability plot reveal clustering pattern directly forming clusters . BIRCH BIRCH organizes data groups summarizing . uses summary create clusters . , BIRCH handle numerical data shown space . Applications Classification key applications classification algorithms Spam Detection common applications classification algorithms spam detection email services . analyzing content , subject line , sender information , algorithms like Naïve Bayes Support Vector Machines classify emails spam legitimate . helps users manage inboxes effectively protects potential phishing attempts malicious content . Facial Recognition Facial recognition systems use security social media algorithms classify confirm identities images videos . Technologies like convolutional neural networks learn extensive face data sets recognize features match stored profiles . technology commonly unlocking devices , surveillance , tagging people photos social media . Customer Churn Prediction Businesses use classification algorithms predict customer churn , predicting customers likely leave service switch competitor . Algorithms like decision trees logistic regression analyze customer behavior , purchase history , engagement spot patterns signal possible churn . helps companies implement focused strategies , like personalized offers better customer support , customers loyal . Credit Scoring Financial institutions use classification algorithms evaluate potential borrowers repay loans . algorithms , logistic regression random forests , analyze factors like credit history , income , employment classify applicants high - risk low - risk . helps banks lenders decide approve deny loan applications , ensuring informed decisions manage risks responsibly . Read : Exploring Data Analytics Marketing Critical Applications Clustering Let applications clustering algorithms . Market Segmentation Businesses utilize clustering algorithms segment market based customer preferences . analyzing customer demographics , purchasing behavior , preferences , algorithms like K - Means hierarchical clustering identify distinct customer groups . helps businesses tailor marketing , products , prices better meet group needs preferences . Studying Social Networks Clustering algorithms social network analysis find groups relationships networks . Algorithms like Girvan - Newman Louvain method identify clusters people groups similar interests interactions . analysis helps study influence patterns viral marketing strategies find communities social media platforms . Image Segmentation image processing , clustering algorithms group pixels based color intensity , texture , proximity segment images meaningful regions objects . Algorithms like K - means mean shift clustering separate different parts image . important medical imaging detect tumors , satellite imagery classify land cover , computer vision recognize objects understand scenes . Recommendation Engines Online platforms use clustering algorithms create recommendation systems customize user content . Algorithms like collaborative filtering K - Means group users similar preferences behavior suggest products , movies , articles match user interests . improves user satisfaction , boosts engagement , increases sales offering personalized recommendations . Classification vs. Regression : Glance comparison regression classification : Classification Regression Basic Maps input values predefined classes categories Converts input values continuous output Includes anticipation Discrete values representing categories labels Continuous values represent numerical data Characteristics anticipated data Unordered , classes inherent order Ordered stacked , output continuous range Procedure calculating Measures accuracy , metrics like precision , recall , F1 score Calculates error , commonly metrics like root mean square error ( RMSE ) Typical Algorithms Logistic regression , decision trees , support vector machines , k - nearest neighbors Linear regression , regression trees , polynomial regression , ridge regression Read : Data Ethics ?
