  ability discover hidden patterns 7 . Measure Quality Clustering 
  Dissimilarity / Similarity metric 
  Similarity expressed terms distance function , typically metric : 
 d(i , j ) 
  definitions distance functions usually different 
 interval - scaled , boolean , categorical , ordinal ratio , vector variables 
  Weights associated different variables based 
 applications data semantics 
  Quality clustering : 
  usually separate “ quality ” function measures 
 “ goodness ” cluster . 
  hard define “ similar ” “ good ”
