 CS 40003 : Data Analytics 4 
 • clustering techniques , similarity ( dissimilarity ) important measurement . 
 • Informally , similarity objects ( e.g. , images , documents , 
 records , etc . ) numerical measure degree objects alike . 
 • dissimilarity hand , alternative ( opposite ) measure 
 degree objects different . 
 • similarity dissimilarity termed proximity . 
 • Usually , similarity dissimilarity non - negative numbers range 
 zero ( highly dissimilar ( similar ) ) finite / infinite value ( highly similar ( 
 dissimilar ) ) . 
 Note : 
 • Frequently , term distance synonym dissimilarity 
 • fact , refer special case dissimilarity . 5 . Similarity Dissimilarity
