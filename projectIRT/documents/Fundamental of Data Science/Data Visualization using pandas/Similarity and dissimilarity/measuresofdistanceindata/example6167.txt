DSA Development Course Measures Distance Data Mining Updated : 30 Jul , 2024 Comments Improve Suggest changes Like Article Like Report Clustering consists grouping certain objects similar , decide items similar dissimilar properties .    Data Mining sense , similarity measure distance dimensions describing object features . means distance data points small high degree similarity objects vice versa . similarity subjective depends heavily context application . example , similarity vegetables determined taste , size , colour etc .    clustering approaches use distance measures assess similarities differences pair objects , popular distance measures : 1 . Euclidean Distance : Euclidean distance considered traditional metric problems geometry . simply explained ordinary distance points . algorithms cluster analysis . algorithms use formula K - mean . Mathematically computes root squared differences coordinates objects . [ Tex]\begin{aligned } 
 d(\mathbf{p } , \mathbf{q})=d(\mathbf{q } , \mathbf{p } ) & = \sqrt{\left(q_{1}-p_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(q_{2}-p_{2}\right)^{2}+\cdots+\left(q_{n}-p_{n}\right)^{2 } } \\ 
 & = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(q_{i}-p_{i}\right)^{2 } } 
 \end{aligned}[/Tex ] Figure – Euclidean Distance 2 . Manhattan Distance : determines absolute difference pair coordinates .   Suppose points P Q determine distance points simply calculate perpendicular distance points X - Axis Y - Axis .   plane P coordinate ( x1 , y1 ) Q ( x2 , y2 ) .   Manhattan distance P Q = |x1 – x2| + |y1 – y2| total distance Red line gives Manhattan distance points . 3 . Jaccard Index : Jaccard distance measures similarity data set items intersection items divided union data items . [ Tex]J(A , B)=\frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}=\frac{|A \cap B|}{|A|+|B|-|A \cap B| } [ /Tex ] Figure – Jaccard Index 4 . Minkowski distance : generalized form Euclidean Manhattan Distance Measure . N - dimensional space , point represented , ( x1 , x2 , ... , xN ) Consider points P1 P2 : P1 : ( X1 , X2 , ... , XN ) P2 : ( Y1 , Y2 , ... , YN ) , Minkowski distance P1 P2 given : [ Tex]\sqrt[p]{(x 1 - y 1)^{p}+(x 2 - y 2)^{p}+\ldots+(x N - y N)^{p } } [ /Tex ] p = 2 , Minkowski distance Euclidean distance . p = 1 , Minkowski distance Manhattan distance . 5 . Cosine Index : Cosine distance measure clustering determines cosine angle vectors given following formula . [ Tex]\operatorname{sim}(A , B)=\cos ( \theta)=\frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| B \| } [ /Tex ] ( theta ) gives angle vectors , B n - dimensional vectors .
