 analysis describe data find patterns exist . Univariate graphical Non - graphical methods provide picture data . Graphical methods required . Common types univariate graphics include : Stem - - leaf plots , data values shape distribution . Histograms , bar plot bar represents frequency ( count ) proportion ( count / total count ) cases range values . Box plots , graphically depict - number summary minimum , quartile , median , quartile , maximum . Multivariate nongraphical Multivariate data arises variable . Multivariate non - graphical EDA techniques generally relationship variables data cross - tabulation statistics . Multivariate graphical Multivariate data uses graphics display relationships sets data . graphic grouped bar plot bar chart group representing level variables bar group representing levels variable . common types multivariate graphics include : Scatter plot , plot data points horizontal vertical axis variable affected . Multivariate chart , graphical representation relationships factors response . Run chart , line graph data plotted time . Bubble chart , data visualization displays multiple circles ( bubbles ) - dimensional plot . Heat map , graphical representation data values depicted color .
