Need help understanding loop - Python Help - Discussions Python.org Discussions Python.org Need help understanding loop Python Help CozyBoat ( Clark ) February 13 , 2024 ,   1:37am 1 new loops , going code book : current_number = 1 
 current_number < = 5 : 
     print(current_number ) 
     current_number + = 1 watching video YouTube , current_number + = 1 escape infinite loop , saw experimenting , understand code print . typing realized print comes supposed prints ( know sure actually lol ) . current_number + = 1 print returned values “ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ” . 6 ? onePythonUser ( Paul ) February 13 , 2024 ,   2:02am 2 Clark : current_number = 1 
 current_number < = 5 : 
     print(current_number ) 
     current_number + = 1 Response : current_number = 1          # Initialize test variable 
 current_number < = 5 : # Condition statement satisfy order execute loop body 
     print(current_number )   # Print value variable 
     current_number + = 1     # Increment variable incrementing variable , goes conditional statement test condition met .   , execute statements body .   condition satisfied , loop continue statement loop body .

CAM - Gerlach ( C.A.M. Gerlach ) February 13 , 2024 ,   3:52am 5 case causing confusion , condition checked time , statement loop . , value incremented print statement , condition checked value printed . think code , let suppose , starting later number brevity : current_number = 5 
 current_number < = 5 : 
     print(current_number ) 
     current_number + = 1 current_number < = 5 , loop runs , 5 printed current_number incremented 6 . condition checked , condition 6 < = 6 false , loop terminates . contrast , current_number = 5 
 current_number < = 5 : 
     current_number + = 1 
     print(current_number ) … happens , number incremented 6 print , 6 printed . sort errors particularly common loops careful , reason real life use loop sort iteration , sequence things want iterate fixed number times : current_number range(1 , 6 ): 
     print(current_number ) shorter avoids type “ ” errors order action incrementing . 4 Likes CozyBoat ( Clark ) February 13 , 2024 ,   4:24pm 6 Thanks helpful replies . reading posts trying clear . reason increment variable indented working directly print function right ? like print function . know , yeah . Maybe saying sense , think good thoughts . Maybe people think . “ continue statement loop body ” , mean increment variable , print ? onePythonUser ( Paul ) February 13 , 2024 ,   4:34pm 7 increment variable statement ( current_number + = 1 ) loop body , print statement . Clark : “ continue statement loop body ” , mean increment variable , print ? Suppose worked warehouse .   boss told inventory parts ‘ ’ type currently available hand .   completed task , packaging parts type ` B ’ .   , 2nd task task completed .   essence meant .   loop task completed , continue task .   code , state explicitly code thing .   , continue . CozyBoat ( Clark ) February 13 , 2024 ,   4:39pm 8 Thanks helpful reply . understand saying starting current number = 5 instead 1 , , value starts 1 original formula increment placed print function , values returned 2,3,4,5 instead 2,3,4,5,6 ? understand 1 incremented 2 , condition says terminate 5 . CozyBoat ( Clark ) February 13 , 2024 ,   4:51pm 9 understand , trying figure increment variable placed print , values returned goes 2 - 6 instead 2 - 5 . chepner ( Clint Hepner ) February 13 , 2024 ,   4:53pm 10 Clark : values returned 2,3,4,5 instead 2,3,4,5,6 ?

 ... onePythonUser ( Paul ) February 13 , 2024 ,   5:02pm 11 Maybe add print statemen follow increment variable bit closely : current_number = 1

Stefan2 ( Stefan ) February 13 , 2024 ,   5:28pm 12 Clark : current_number + = 1 escape infinite loop think immediately triggers escape . . eventually makes current_number large time - condition evaluated , condition false loop body entered . happens current execution loop body completed . 2 Likes MRAB ( Matthew Barnett ) February 13 , 2024 ,   6:27pm 13 think misled meaning word “ ” English .

CozyBoat ( Clark ) February 13 , 2024 , 11:24pm 16 Ok . studying code thread experimenting , tell got right . current number 1 . set conditional loop says exit loop 5 . increment variable print function saying : Pete : Hey , Phil . need numbers printed . printer set start 1 , want 2 - 6 . +1 button , kick things 2 . Set cycle end 5 , +1 end 6 . hit print button acknowledges want . Phil : start 2 end 6 hitting +1 button ? Pete : printer programmers better . unlike range loop ( 1,6 ) 1 - 5 , ( 1,5 ) 2 - 6 , print . onePythonUser ( Paul ) February 13 , 2024 , 11:59pm 17 visual help .

 Main ( ) CozyBoat ( Clark ) February 16 , 2024 , 12:30am 20 Thanks making flowchart ! drew created columns . clear , thing sure , starting maybe , 2 - 6 thing . printing stops going 5 , stop increment ? putting print kick 2 ( printed ) hits 5 , adds 1 , ends 6 printing “ current_number +1 ” , printing ( current_number ) , scenarios , print function , ends 5 . Maybe realize current_number stop   “ current_number + = 1 ” thing . Edit : Hopefully right track . - reading typed , sounds kinda contradictory printing “ current_number = + 1 ” add 1 code print , current_number like end 5 , goes 6 scenario 5 6 team point . page → Home Categories Guidelines Terms Service Privacy Policy Powered Discourse , best viewed JavaScript enabled
