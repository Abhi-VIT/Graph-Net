         print(lo ) 
     # loop continues want end loops , explicitly - example , 
 use boolean variable : keep_running = True

 index , value enumerate(l ): 
     value > = 3 :

     print(index ) changed condition value < 3 : value > = 3 : improved readability . Share Improve answer Follow answered Jul 25 , 2014 12:52 Matthias Matthias 13.2k 6 6 gold badges 45 45 silver badges 50 50 bronze badges Add comment | 0 break cancels inner loop work : l=[0,1,2,3,4 ]
