Quiz : Test knowledge interactive “ Python Loops : Repeating Tasks Conditionally ” quiz . receive score completion help track learning progress : Interactive Quiz Python Loops : Repeating Tasks Conditionally quiz , test understanding Python loop . loop allows execute block code repeatedly long given condition remains true . Understanding use loops effectively crucial skill Python developer . Getting Started Python Loops programming , loops control flow statements allow repeat given set operations number times . practice , find main types loops : loops iterate known number times , common processing data collections specific number data items . loops commonly iterate unknown number times , useful number iterations depends given condition . Python loops tutorial , learn loops . Python , generally use loops need repeat series tasks unknown number times . Python loops compound statements header code block runs given condition false . basic syntax loop shown : Python Syntax condition : < body > syntax , condition expression loop evaluates truth value . condition true , loop body runs . , loop terminates . Note loop body consist statements indented properly . detailed breakdown syntax : keyword initiates loop header . condition expression evaluated truthiness defines exit condition . < body > consists statements execute iteration . quick example use loop iterate decreasing sequence numbers : Python > > > number = 5 > > > number > 0 : ... print ( number ) ... number -= 1 ... 5 4 3 2 1 example , number > 0 loop condition . condition returns false value , loop terminates . body consists print ( ) displays value screen . , decrease value number . change produce different result loop evaluates condition iteration . loop runs condition remains true . condition turns false , loop terminates , program execution proceeds statement loop body . example , loop terminates number reaches value equal 0 . loop condition false , potentially infinite loop . Consider following loop , fingers near Ctrl + C key combination terminate execution : Python > > > number = 5 > > > number ! = 0 : ... print ( number ) ... number -= 1 ... 5 4 3 2 1 > > > number = 5 > > > number ! = 0 : ... print ( number ) ... number -= 2 ... 5 3 1 -1 -3 -5 -7 -9 -11 Traceback ( recent ): ... KeyboardInterrupt example , loop condition number ! = 0 . condition works decrease number 1 . , decrease 2 , condition false , resulting potentially infinite loop . cases , usually terminate loop pressing Ctrl + C , raises KeyboardInterrupt exception operating systems . Note loop checks condition happens . false start , loop body run : Python > > > number = 0 > > > number > 0 : ... print ( number ) ... number -= 1 ... example , loop finds number greater 0 , immediately terminates execution entering loop body . , body executes . know basic syntax loops , time dive practical examples Python . section , loops applied real - world scenarios . Remove ads Advanced Loop Syntax Python loop advanced features flexible powerful . features helpful need fine - tune loop meet specific execution flows . far , seen examples entire loop body runs iteration . Python provides keywords let modify behavior : break : Immediately terminates loop . program execution proceeds statement following loop body . continue : Ends current iteration . execution jumps loop header , loop condition evaluated determine loop execute . Python loops additional syntax . clause runs loop terminates naturally condition true . following sections , learn break continue statements work , use clause effectively loops . break Statement : Exiting Loop Early break statement , terminate execution loop program continue statement immediately loop body . short script demonstrates break statement works : Python break.py number = 6 number > 0 : number -= 1 number = = 2 : break print ( number ) print ( " Loop ended " ) number 2 , break statement reached , loop terminates completely . program execution jumps print ( ) final line script . Running break.py command line produces following output : Shell $ python break .py 5 4 3 Loop ended loop prints values normally . number reaches value 2 , break runs , terminating loop printing Loop ended screen . Note 2 1 printed . important note makes little sense break statements outside conditionals . Suppose include break statement directly loop body wrapping conditional . case , loop terminate iteration , potentially running entire loop body . continue Statement : Skipping Tasks Iteration , continue statement . statement , skip tasks current iteration given condition met . script identical previous section continue statement place break : Python continue.py number = 6 number > 0 : number -= 1 number = = 2 : continue print ( number ) print ( " Loop ended " ) output continue.py looks like : Shell $ python continue .py 5 4 3 1 0 Loop ended time , number 2 , continue statement terminates iteration . 2 printed . control returns loop header , condition - evaluated . loop continues number reaches 0 , point terminates . Remove ads Clause : Running Tasks Natural Loop Termination Python allows optional clause end loops . syntax shown : Python Syntax condition : < body > : < body > code clause run loop terminates naturally encountering break statement . words , executes loop condition false , . Note sense clause loop break statement . case , placing block content loop — indentation — work cleaner . clause loop useful ? common use case need break loop . Consider following example : Python connection.py import random import time MAX_RETRIES = 5 attempts = 0 attempts < MAX_RETRIES : attempts + = 1 print ( f " Attempt { attempts } : Connecting server ... " ) # Simulating connection scenario time . sleep ( 0.3 ) random . choice ( [ False , False , False , True ] ): print ( " Connection successful ! " ) break print ( " Connection failed . Retrying ... " ) : print ( " attempts failed . Unable connect . " ) script simulates process connecting external server . loop lets try connect number times , defined MAX_RETRIES constant . connection successful , break statement terminates loop . Note : example , random module simulate successful unsuccessful connection . use module examples tutorial . learn random data , check Generating Random Data Python ( Guide ) tutorial . connection attempts fail , clause executes , letting know attempts unsuccessful . ahead run script times check results . Writing Effective Loops Python writing loops Python , ensure efficient readable . need sure terminate correctly . Normally , choose use loop need repeat series actions given condition false remains true . type loop way need process items iterable . case , use loop instead . following sections , learn use loops effectively , avoid infinite loops , implement control statements like break continue , leverage clause handling loop completion gracefully . Running Tasks Based Condition Loops general use case loop waiting resource available proceeding use . common scenarios like following : Waiting file created populated Checking server online Polling database record ready Ensuring REST API responsive making requests loop continually checks given file created : Python check_file.py import time pathlib import Path filename = Path ( " hello.txt " ) print ( f " Waiting { filename . } created ... " ) filename . exists ( ): print ( " File found . Retrying 1 second ... " ) time . sleep ( 1 ) print ( f " { filename } found ! Proceeding processing . " ) open ( filename , mode = " r " ) file : print ( " File contents : " ) print ( file . read ( ) ) loop script uses .exists ( ) method Path object . method returns True target file exits . operator negates check result , returning True file exit . case , loop waits second run iteration check file . run script , like following : Shell $ python check_file.py Waiting hello.txt created ... File found . Retrying 1 second ... File found . Retrying 1 second ... File found . Retrying 1 second ... ... meantime , open terminal create hello.txt file . loop finds newly created file , terminate . , code loop run , printing file content screen . Remove ads Loops Unknown Number Iterations loops great need process stream data unknown number items . scenario , know required number iterations , use loop True control condition . technique provides Pythonic way write loops run unknown number iterations . illustrate , suppose need read temperature sensor continuously provides data . temperature equal greater 28 degrees Celsius , stop monitoring . loop accomplish task : Python temperature.py import random import time def read_temperature ( ): return random . uniform ( 20.0 , 30.0 ) True : temperature = read_temperature ( ) print ( f " Temperature : { temperature : .2f } ° C " ) temperature > = 28 : print ( " Required temperature reached ! Stopping monitoring . " ) break time . sleep ( 1 ) loop , use True loop condition , generates continually running loop . , read temperature sensor print current temperature value . temperature equal greater 25 degrees , break loop . , wait second read sensor . Removing Items Iterable Loop Modifying collection iteration risky , especially need remove items target collection . cases , loop good solution . example , need process list values remove value processed . situation , use loop like following : Python > > > colors = [ " red " , " blue " , " yellow " , " green " ] > > > colors : ... color = colors . pop ( - 1 ) ... print ( f " Processing color : { color } " ) ... Processing color : green Processing color : yellow Processing color : blue Processing color : red evaluate list Boolean context , True contains elements False . example , colors remains true long elements . remove items .pop ( ) method , colors false , loop terminates . Getting User Input Loop Getting user input command line common use case loops Python . Consider following loop takes input built - input ( ) functions . loop runs type word " stop " : Python user_input.py line = input ( " Type text : " ) line ! = " stop " : print ( line ) line = input ( " Type text : " ) input ( ) function asks user enter text . , assign result line variable . loop condition checks content line different " stop " , case , loop body executes . Inside loop , input ( ) . loop repeats user types word stop . example works , drawback unnecessarily repeating input ( ) . avoid repetition walrus operator code snippet : Python > > > ( line : = input ( " Type text : " ) ) ! = " stop " : ... print ( line ) ... Type text : Python Python Type text : Walrus Walrus Type text : stop updated loop , user input line variable assignment expression . time , expression returns user input compared sentinel value " stop " . Traversing Iterators Loops loop built - ( ) function great way fine - control iteration process working iterators iterables . idea works , rewrite loop loop instead . Consider following code : Python for_loop.py requests = [ " request " , " second request " , " request " ] print ( " \n loop " ) request requests : print ( f " Handling { request } " ) print ( " \n loop " ) = iter ( requests ) True : try : request = ( ) StopIteration : break print ( f " Handling { request } " ) loops equivalent . run script , loop handle requests turn : Shell $ python for_loop.py - loop Handling request Handling second request Handling request - loop Handling request Handling second request Handling request Python loops flexible powerful , generally prefer need iterate given collection . , translating loop loop , like , gives flexibility handle iterator . Remove ads Emulating - Loops - loop control flow statement executes code block , regardless loop condition true false . come languages like C , C++ , Java , JavaScript , wondering Python - loop . bad news Python . good news emulate loop break statement . Consider following example , takes user input loop : Python > > > True : ... number = int ( input ( " Enter positive number : " ) ) ... print ( number ) ... number > 0 : ... break ... Enter positive number : 1 1 Enter positive number : 4 4 Enter positive number : -1 -1 , loop takes user input built - input ( ) function . input converted integer number int ( ) . user enters number 0 lower , break statement runs , loop terminates . Note emulate - loop Python , condition terminates loop goes end loop , body break statement . important emphasize type loop , body runs . Loops Event Loops common extended use case loops Python create event loops , infinite loops wait certain actions known events . event happens , loop dispatches appropriate event handler . classic examples fields find event loops include following : Graphical user interface ( GUI ) frameworks Game development Asynchronous applications Server processes example , want implement number - guessing game . loop : Python guess.py random import randint LOW , HIGH = 1 , 10 secret_number = randint ( LOW , HIGH ) clue = " " # Game loop True : guess = input ( f " Guess number { LOW } { HIGH } { clue } " ) number = int ( guess ) number > secret_number : clue = f " ( { number } ) " elif number < secret_number : clue = f " ( greater { number } ) " : break print ( f " guessed ! secret number { number } " ) example , game loop runs game logic . , takes user guess input ( ) , converts integer number , checks greater secret number . clause executes user guess equal secret number . case , loop breaks , game shows winning message . Exploring Infinite Loops , write loop naturally terminate . loop behavior commonly known infinite loop , accurate , end , terminate loop . write infinite loop intentionally unintentionally . Intentional infinite loops powerful tools commonly programs need run continuously external condition met , game loops , server processes , event - driven apps like GUI apps asynchronous code . contrast , unintentional infinite loops result kind logical issue prevents loop condition false . example , happen loop : Fails update condition variable Uses condition logically flawed cases , loop erroneously continues run terminated externally . following sections , learn types infinite loops approach code . kick things , start unintentional infinite loops . Remove ads Unintentional Infinite Loops Suppose write loop ends internal error . Getting example initial section tutorial , following loop runs continuously : Python > > > number = 5 > > > number ! = 0 : ... print ( number ) ... number -= 2 ... 5 3 1 -1 -3 -5 -7 -9 -11 Traceback ( recent ): ... KeyboardInterrupt terminate code , press Ctrl + C , interrupts program execution keyboard . , loop run indefinitely condition turns false . real - world code , typically want proper loop condition prevent unintended infinite execution . cases like , prevent potentially infinite loop fixing condition internal loop logic sure condition false point loop execution . example , modify condition bit fix issue : Python > > > number = 5 > > > number > 0 : ... print ( number ) ... number -= 2 ... ... 5 3 1 time , loop 0 value . Instead , terminates number value equal 0 . Alternatively , use additional conditionals loop body terminate loop break : Python > > > number = 5 > > > number ! = 0 : ... number < = 0 : ... break ... print ( number ) ... number -= 2 ... 5 3 1 loop original loop condition . , includes failsafe condition loop body terminate case main condition fails . Figuring fix unintentional infinite loop largely depend logic loop condition body . , analyze case carefully determine correct solution . Intentional Infinite Loops Intentionally infinite loops pretty common useful . , writing correctly requires ensuring proper exit conditions , avoiding performance issues , preventing unintended infinite execution . example , want write code service starts runs forever , accepting service requests . Forever , context , means shut . typical way write infinite loop use True construct . ensure loop terminates naturally , add break statements wrapped proper conditions : Python Syntax True : condition_1 : break ... condition_2 : break ... condition_n : break syntax works multiple reasons end loop . cleaner break different locations try specify termination conditions loop header . construct practice , consider following infinite loop asks user provide password : Python password.py MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3 correct_password = " secret123 " attempts = 0 True : password = input ( " Password : " ) . strip ( ) attempts + = 1 password = = correct_password : print ( " Login successful ! Welcome ! " ) break attempts > = MAX_ATTEMPTS : print ( " failed attempts . " ) break : print ( f " Incorrect password . { MAX_ATTEMPTS - attempts } attempts left . " ) loop exit conditions . condition checks password correct . second condition checks user reached maximum number attempts provide correct password . conditions include break statement finish loop gracefully .
