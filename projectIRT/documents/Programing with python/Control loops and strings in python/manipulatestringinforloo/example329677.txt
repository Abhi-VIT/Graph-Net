 field containing object labels want insert text . 
 values list search string specific values . 
 able manipulate found results , value . 
 know strings work differently Python ( immutable ) , know resolve problem way . objectList = [ ( ' Object A','Object B','Object C ' , ' Object D ' ) ] 
 objectString = ' " Object " , " Object B " , " Object C " , " Object D " ' 

 def transform_toString(objects , old_format ): 
     obj = objects 
     new_format = old_format 
     o obj : 
         position = new_format.find(str(o ) ) 
         new_format = new_format[:position ] + ' found ' + new_format[position :] 
     return new_format 
    
 transformed_string = transform_toString(objectList , objectString ) results following output : " Object " , " Object B " , " Object C " , " Object D found " achieve following output ? " Object found " , " Object B found " , " Object C found " , " Object D found " python string - loop Share Improve question Follow asked Jun 2 , 2022 13:08 Sef Sef 81 8 8 bronze badges 2 explain elected store ObjectList list length 1 hold 4 - tuple – Daweo Commented Jun 2 , 2022 13:12 matter , came example . actual case working right dataframe column values . – Sef Commented Jun 2 , 2022 13:14 Add comment | 2 Answers 2 Sorted : Reset default Highest score ( default ) Trending ( recent votes count ) Date modified ( newest ) Date created ( oldest ) 1 multiple errors code . recommend install IDE debugger , jump forloop happening . look bit closer , iterating array 1 element ( ' Object A','Object B','Object C ' , ' Object D ' ) ( tuple 4 items ) searching tuple string . normally result error different programming languages , tries find tuple reason writes found end look return value ( recommend checking documentation ) iit returns -1 means element found . python , -1 indicates element array ( case character string ) , fix type , result desired . remove parantases , " foundObject " , " foundObject B " , " foundObject C " , " foundObject D " . order fix , need pointer ( position ) offset word length . fixed code : objectList = [ ' Object ' , ' Object B ' , ' Object C ' , ' Object D ' ]

 objectString = ' " Object " , " Object B " , " Object C " , " Object D " ' 

 def transform_toString(objects , old_format ): 
     obj = objects # nt need 
     new_format = old_format # nt need 
     o obj[0 ] : 
         position = new_format.find(str(o ) ) 
         position = = -1 : 
             continue 
         objlen = len(o ) 
         position = new_format.find(str(o ) ) + objlen 
         new_format = new_format[:position ] + ' found ' + new_format[position :]
