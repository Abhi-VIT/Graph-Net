Apr 26th , 2024 4:00am Jack Wallen Feature image Unsplash . Loops integral Python code , struggle effectively ( having use far code purpose ) . loops , create automated tasks repeat actions particular condition met . use loops iterate sequence items loops continue executing statements long condition true . find times need exit loop , skip iteration , ignore condition . example , create loop executes statement condition met need break loop different condition occurs . simple example : create loop print “ Hello , New Stack ! ” want break loop discovers S character . simple way real - world application , makes good demonstration . Let create bit code . start defining text like : t = ' Hello , New Stack ! ' 1 t = ' Hello , New Stack ! ' create loop iterates string includes break statement catch S character . loop looks like : letter t : 

      print(letter ) 

      letter = = ' : 

        break 



 print("For Loop Broken " ) 

 print ( ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 letter t : print ( letter ) letter = = ' : break print ( " Loop Broken " ) print ( ) entire code block looks like : t = ' Hello , New Stack ! ' 



 letter t : 

      print(letter ) 

      letter = = ' : 

        break 



 print("For Loop Broken " ) 

 print ( ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 t = ' Hello , New Stack ! ' letter t : print ( letter ) letter = = ' : break print ( " Loop Broken " ) print ( ) run code , output look like : H e l l o , N e w S Loop Broken , soon loop hits S , breaks loop . loop , like : t = ' Hello , New Stack ! ' 

 = 0 



 True :  

     print(t[i ] )    



     t[i ] = = ' :  

         break 

     + = 1 



 print("While Loop Broken " ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 t = ' Hello , New Stack ! ' = 0 True : print ( t [ ] ) t [ ] = = ' : break + = 1 print ( " Loop Broken " ) Run code output loop . form loop control continue statement skip execution statement block returns control beginning loop start iteration . words , remaining statements loop skipped current iteration loop begin iteration . Remember , break statement , loop reached letter S , broke past character ignored . continue statement , loop reaches S immediately returns iterates , print remaining characters . code look like : letter ' New Stack ' : 

    letter = = ' : 

       continue 

    print ( ' Current Letter : ' , letter ) 1 2 3 4 letter ' New Stack ' : letter = = ' : continue print ( ' Current Letter : ' , letter ) run , output : Current Letter = N Current Letter = e Current Letter = w Current Letter = Current Letter = t Current Letter = Current Letter = c Current Letter = k , loop skips S continues iterate entire string ( minus S ) printed . loop . time count backwards 10 0 skip 7 . code looks like : var = 11 

 var > 0 : 

    var = var -1 

    var = = 7 : 

       continue 

    print ( ' Current Value : ' , var ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 var = 11 var > 0 : var = var - 1 var = = 7 : continue print ( ' Current Value : ' , var ) Run : Current Value : 10 Current Value : 9 Current Value : 8 Current Value : 6 Current Value : 5 Current Value : 4 Current Value : 3 Current Value : 2 Current Value : 1 Current Value : 0 loop control pass statement , acts sort null operation . pass loop control , code executed . come handy want write loops ( placeholder code plan writing later want consume iterator ) . Let create block code prints New Stack includes loop function definition , use pass statement . code look like : s = " New Stack " 



 s : 

     pass 



 def fun ( ): 

     pass 



 fun ( ) 



 s : 

     = = ' : 

         print('Pass Statement ' ) 

         pass 

     print(i ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 s = " New Stack " s : pass def fun ( ): pass fun ( ) s : = = ' : print ( ' Pass Statement ' ) pass print ( ) run code , output : N e w Pass Statement S t c k , initial loop function skipped include pass statement . use break , continue , pass loop controls Python . help statements , effectively efficiently use loops . gain experience language , come appreciate loop control statements .
