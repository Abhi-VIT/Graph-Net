Python , operator precedence determines order operators evaluated expression . like mathematics , certain operators higher precedence . means evaluated operators lower precedence . Python follows set predefined rules determine operator precedence . example , multiplication division higher precedence addition subtraction . means expressions containing multiplication addition operators evaluated follows : 3 + 4 * 5   # evaluates 23 , 35 example , multiplication operator higher precedence addition operator , evaluated . expression evaluated written follows : 3 + ( 4 * 5 ) addition basic arithmetic operators ( + , - , * , / , % ) , Python variety operators different precedences . examples : Comparison operators (= = , ! = , > , < , > = , < =) lower precedence arithmetic operators . Logical operators ( , , ) lower precedence comparison operators . Assignment operators (= , + = , -= , * = , /= ) lower precedence operators . sure precedence particular operator , use parentheses explicitly specify order operations . example , expression , addition operation evaluated multiplication , parentheses override normal precedence rules : ( 3 + 4 ) * 5   # evaluates 35 , 23 table shows precedence associativity Python operators , highest lowest precedence : Note operators higher precedence evaluated operators lower precedence . cases operators precedence , evaluation order determined associativity ( left right right left ) . precedence associativity rules apply control structures Python , including loops conditional statements . tips tricks working Python operator precedence : Use parentheses explicitly specify order operations : sure precedence particular operator , want override normal precedence rules , use parentheses explicitly specify order operations . code readable help prevent errors . Use white space improve readability : writing expressions multiple operators , helpful use white space improve readability . example , instead writing “ x+y*z ” , write “ x + y * z ” . easier order operations understand code . Use comparison logical operators carefully : Comparison logical operators different precedences arithmetic operators , important use carefully avoid errors . example , expression combines comparison arithmetic operators , sure understand order operations use parentheses necessary clarify expression . Know precedence commonly operators : important know precedence commonly operators , multiplication , division , addition , subtraction , comparison operators . help write correct efficient code avoid errors . Test code variety inputs : code , important test code uses operator precedence variety inputs ensure works correctly efficiently . Associativity non associativity : Associativity non - associativity refer operators evaluated precedence . expression contains multiple operators precedence , associativity determines order operations performed . Left - associativity means operations evaluated left right , right - associativity means evaluated right left . example , expression + b + c , addition operators precedence left - associative . means expression evaluated ( + b ) + c , addition b performed addition c. Non - associativity means operators chained parentheses explicitly specify order operations . example , assignment operator = non - associative , means expressions like = b = c allowed . Instead , use parentheses specify order operations , ( = b ) = c = ( b = c ) . important aware associativity non - associativity writing expressions Python , impact outcome code . PEMDAS PEMDAS acronym stands “ Parentheses , Exponents , Multiplication Division , Addition Subtraction ” . common mnemonic remember order operations mathematical expressions . Python , order operations follows principles PEMDAS . , expressions inside parentheses evaluated , followed exponents , multiplication division ( left right ) , finally addition subtraction ( left right ) . example , consider expression 2 + 3 * 4 . Following order operations , perform multiplication ( 3 * 4 = 12 ) , addition ( 2 + 12 = 14 ) . , value expression 14 . important order operations mind writing mathematical expressions Python . unsure order operations , use parentheses explicitly specify order evaluation . Conclusion Python operator precedence important concept working Python expressions contain multiple operators . understanding rules best practices operator precedence , write correct , efficient , readable code performs complex operations accurately quickly . beginner experienced Python developer , mastering operator precedence help write better code programming skills level . time working expressions contain multiple operators , sure tips tricks mind Python powerful operator system .
